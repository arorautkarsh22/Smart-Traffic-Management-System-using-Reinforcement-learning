# üö¶ Smart Traffic Management System using Reinforcement Learning

## ‚ú® Overview

This project implements an **Adaptive Traffic Management System (ATMS)** utilizing **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, specifically **Q-Learning**, to dynamically optimize traffic signal timings in real-time. The system provides dynamic, adaptive control for urban congestion.

The core objective is to minimize congestion, reduce vehicle waiting times, and enhance overall urban mobility efficiency compared to traditional fixed-time or loop-detector-based signal systems.

### üéØ Key Results

The system is designed to achieve significant performance improvements, including:
* **Reduced Travel Time** (up to 25% reported)
* **Reduced Emissions** (up to 20% reported)
* **Real-time Optimization** of traffic flow.

## üí° Key Features

* **Dynamic Signal Control:** The RL agent continuously learns and adjusts traffic light phases and durations based on real-time traffic density and flow observed in the simulation.
* **Congestion Reduction:** Aims to significantly reduce average vehicle waiting time, queue length, and overall travel delay across the network.
* **Emergency Vehicle Prioritization:** Designed to detect and prioritize emergency vehicles, striving for minimal waiting time for critical transit.
* **SUMO Integration:** Leverages the robust **SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)** platform for accurate microscopic traffic simulation and performance evaluation.
* **Adaptive Learning:** The RL approach allows the system to adapt automatically to unpredictable traffic disruptions like accidents or roadblocks.
